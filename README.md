Personal Blog:

GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN users load the app,
THEN they are presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
WHEN users submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
WHEN the form submits,
THEN users are redirected to the posts page.
WHEN users enter try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN users are presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
WHEN users view the posts page,
THEN users are presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
WHEN users click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
WHEN users click the "Back" button,
THEN they are redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
WHEN users view the main content,
THEN they are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
WHEN users view localStorage,
THEN they are presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
WHEN users take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN they can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
WHEN users view the footer,
THEN they are presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
